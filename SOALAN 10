#Soalan 10 (Masalah dunia sebenar – lengkap & berurutan)
#Create a Python program that receives:
#the distance (in km) travelled
#the time (in hours) taken
#Then calculate and display the average speed (km/h) with a clear output message.

#answer
distance_number = input("enter the distance travelled (km): ")
distance = float(distance_number)

time_travelled = input("enter the time taken (hours): ")
time = float(time_travelled)

average_speed = distance / time
print(f"average speed is: {average_speed} km/h ")
