#Create a Python program that receives two numbers from the user and displays:
#the sum
#the difference
#the product

#answer
first_number = input("enter the first number: ")
second_number = input("enter the second number: ")

first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = int(second_number)

sum_number = first_number + second_number
print(f"the sum number of {first_number} and {second_number} is: {sum_number}")

difference_number = first_number - second_number
print(f"the difference between {first_number} and {second_number} is: {difference_number} ")

product_number = first_number * second_number
print(f"the product of {first_number} and {second_number} is: {product_number}")
